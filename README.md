### 📚 What I Learned

This project was a hands-on practice for learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  

Key takeaways:

- Better understanding of arrays and their methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)  
- Connecting logic with the user interface  
- Practicing event handling and input validation  

Even though I’m still learning, this project shows my **motivation, curiosity, and willingness to experiment**.
